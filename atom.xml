    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, I worked as a full-time Software Engineer Intern at IKEA for 10 months. My job was mainly delivering frontends for the IKEA WeChat SMP.  I also contributed to the static webpage library for the APP/SMP team.</p><h1 id="Project-overview"><a href="#Project-overview" class="headerlink" title="Project overview"></a>Project overview</h1><p>The project I mainly worked on during my internship is called IKEA WeChat SMP.</p><p>I created reusable components like address selector, broadcast popups, configurable floating buttons, advertise card, etc. and I also designed and implemented product inventory module, optimized logic for delivery, live stream, checkout and coupons.</p><p>If you are a WeChat user, you can search for the IKEA WeChat SMP program in WeChat.</p><p>What we built is basically the online shopping center of IKEA integrated in WeChat, which is the most widely used (1.25 billion monthly active users) social app in China.</p><p>I was lucky enough to participate in the initial building work and witness the official nationwide launch of this project. This project achieved <strong>6x,xxx</strong> average <strong>daily</strong> active users with <strong>6xx.xK</strong> RMB average sales <strong>per day</strong> after the official launch.</p><h1 id="A-day-in-my-life-at-IKEA"><a href="#A-day-in-my-life-at-IKEA" class="headerlink" title="A day in my life at IKEA"></a>A day in my life at IKEA</h1><p>My work time is usually from 9:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Monday to Friday.</p><h2 id="Morning-routine-Stand-up-meeting"><a href="#Morning-routine-Stand-up-meeting" class="headerlink" title="Morning routine: Stand-up meeting"></a>Morning routine: Stand-up meeting</h2><p>Every morning when I arrive at our office building, our team will have a daily stand-up meeting to talk about our progress and check the obstacles in our work. It is usually about 10 minutes, and it marks the start of my day at work. </p><p>This is also my best chance to know about what other people in my team are working on. Gradually, I gained a more comprehensive understanding of the projects’ status in my team as well.</p><h2 id="Sprint-start-getting-my-tasks-on-JIRA"><a href="#Sprint-start-getting-my-tasks-on-JIRA" class="headerlink" title="Sprint start: getting my tasks on JIRA"></a>Sprint start: getting my tasks on JIRA</h2><p>Since I worked in a Scrum team, we have sprints. A sprint is like an iteration period.  A normal sprint is 2 weeks usually. When the sprint starts, we will have an Iteration (or Sprint) Planning Meeting (IPM). In this meeting, we will discuss how much of the backlog can be committed to and delivered in this sprint. The tasks will be evaluated in story points.</p><p>After the sprint starts, I will have several tasks on JIRA which show the work I need to get done in this sprint. I am also responsible to update my task status every day.</p><h2 id="Sprint-ongoing-develop-discuss-and-deliver"><a href="#Sprint-ongoing-develop-discuss-and-deliver" class="headerlink" title="Sprint ongoing: develop, discuss, and deliver"></a>Sprint ongoing: develop, discuss, and deliver</h2><p>During the sprint, I would discuss some ambiguous points with the Product Owner, and code to meet up the expectations. This process also includes a lot of conversations with the UI/UX designer, the Quality Assurance Engineer, the Backend Development Engineer, and even people from other teams or departments. </p><p>At first I was super shy and it was a big challenge for me to gather the courage to start conversations with so many people. It is because of how nice the people here are that makes me comfortable to express my opinion and become more and more confident. </p><p>When I think my code is ready, I would inform a QA Engineer to put my code into testing. When the testings are passed, and the PO thinks it fulfills the acceptance criteria, my code will go online to our shopping program for people to use.</p><h2 id="Snacks-are-amazing"><a href="#Snacks-are-amazing" class="headerlink" title="Snacks are amazing!!"></a>Snacks are amazing!!</h2><p>Here we have different kinds of snacks and fruit every day. I love the cheesecakes - I know it’s not that healthy - which are so beautiful and delicious. The kiwis here are always sweeter than the ones I brought from the market. And when there’s an activity or party, we have more. There are yogurt, bread, chocolate cake, fried chicken, meatballs, sausages, cookies, sushis, more than ten kinds of drinks…</p><h1 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h1><p>2020 was definitely a special year for many people. For me as well.</p><p>Instead of pursuing my graduate study right after finishing my undergrad study as I originally planned, I was “forced” by COVID-19 to take a gap year and did my first formal internship in life. I was lucky enough to spend this year with people at IKEA.</p><p>I wanted to thank everyone in my team, who was the kindest person and most willing to answer my questions at any time. I also wanted to especially thank my line manager Leo and my mentor, Ciki, who perfected my internship.</p><p>When I first arrived at IKEA, I almost knew nothing about real-industry software development. Ciki was always happy to give me useful instructions and show me the right direction to work in.</p><p>It was a great time working here, and the people here were so welcoming and so supportive to me.</p><p>See you, IKEA!</p><img src="/images/post-content/IKEA_badge.jpg" style="max-width: 40%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 40px;">]]></content>
