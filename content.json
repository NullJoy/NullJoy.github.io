A scalability problem: your system is fast for a single user, but slow under heavy load. Latency vs Throughput Latency: time to perform some action or to produce some result. Throughtput: number of such actions or results per unit of time. Aim for macimmal throughtput with acceptable latency. Availability vs ConsistencyCAP theoremIn a distributed computer system, you can only support 2 of the following guarantees: Contsistency: every read receives the most recent write or an error. Availability: every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information. Partition Tolerance: the system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures. Networks are not reliable, so partition tolerance needs to be supported. We need to make a software tradeoff between consistency and availability. CP (consistency &amp; partition tolerance) Waiting for a resopnse from the partitioned node might result in a timeout error. CP is a good choice if your business requires atomic reads and writes. AP (availability &amp; partition tolerance) Responses return the most readily available version of the data available on any node, which might not be the latest. Writes might take some time to propagate when the partition is resolved. AP is a good choice if your business needs to allow for eventual consistency or when the system needs to continue working despite external errors. Consistency patternsWeak consistencyAfter a write, reads may or may not see it. A best effort approach is taken. E.g. memcached, VoIP, video chat, realtime multiplayer games. (If you are on a phone call and lose reception for a few second, when you regain connection you do not hear what was spoken during connection loss.) Eventual consistencyAfter a write, reads will eventually see it (typically within milliseconds). Data is replicated asynchronously. E.g. DNS, email, highly available systems. Strong consistencyAfter a write, reads will see it. Data is replicated synchronously. E.g. file systems, RDBMSes, systems that need transactions. Availability patternsFail-overActive-passive Heartbeats are sent between the active and the passive server on standby. If the heartbeat is interrupted, the passive server takes over the active‚Äôs IP address and resumes service. The length of downtime is determined by whether the passive server is already running in ‚Äòhot‚Äô standby or whether it needs to start up from ‚Äòcold‚Äô standby; only the active server handles traffic. Can also be referred to as master-slave fail-over. Active-active Both servers are managing traffic, spreading the load between them. If the servers are public-facing, the DNS would need to know about the public IPs of both servers; if the servers are internal-facing, application logic would need to know about both servers. Can also be referred to as master-master fail-over. Disadvantages of fail-over Adds more hardware and additional complexity. There‚Äôs a potential for loss of data if the active system fails before any newly written data can be replicated to the passive. ReplicationFuther discussed in the Database section. Master-slave replication Master-master replication Availability in numbersAvailability is often quantified by uptime (or downtime) as a percentage of time the service is available. Availability is measured in number of 9s (a service with 99.99% availability is described as having four 9s). 99.9% availability -&gt; three 9s (8h 45min 57s downtime per year) 99.99% availability -&gt; four 9s (52min 35.7s downtime per year) Availability in parallel vs in sequence If a service consists of multiple components prone to failure, the service‚Äôs overall availability depends on whether the components are in sequence or in parallel. In sequence Availability (components) &lt; 100% -&gt; Availability (total) ‚Üì Availability (total) = Availability (foo) * Availability (bar) In parallel Availability (components) &lt; 100% -&gt; Availability (total) ‚Üë Availability (total) = 1 - (1 - Availability (foo)) * (1 - Availability(bar)) Domain name systemContent delivery network (CDN)Load balancerReverse proxy (web server)Application layerDatabaseCacheAsynchronismCommunicationSecurityAppendixHow to approach a system design interview questionReferences system design primer","categories":[{"name":"Tech Misc","slug":"Tech-Misc","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Tech-Misc/"}],"tags":[{"name":"System design","slug":"System-design","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/System-design/"}]},{"title":"My journey at IKEA Digital Hub","slug":"My-journey-at-IKEA-Digital-Hub","date":"2021-09-05T22:41:31.000Z","updated":"2025-04-28T05:30:11.448Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/09/05/My-journey-at-IKEA-Digital-Hub/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2021/09/05/My-journey-at-IKEA-Digital-Hub/","excerpt":"","text":"Last year, I worked as a full-time Software Engineer Intern at IKEA for 10 months. My job was mainly delivering frontends for the IKEA WeChat SMP. I also contributed to the static webpage library for the APP/SMP team. Project overviewThe project I mainly worked on during my internship is called IKEA WeChat SMP. I created reusable components like address selector, broadcast popups, configurable floating buttons, advertisement card, etc. and I also designed and implemented product inventory module, optimized logic for delivery, live stream, checkout and coupons. If you are a WeChat user, you can search for the IKEA WeChat SMP program in WeChat. What we built is basically the online shopping center of IKEA integrated in WeChat, which is the most widely used (1.25 billion monthly active users) social app in China. I was lucky enough to participate in the initial building work and witness the official nationwide launch of this project. This project achieved 6x,xxx average daily active users with 6xx.xK RMB average sales per day after the official launch. A day in my life at IKEAMy work time was usually from 9:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Monday to Friday. Morning routine: Stand-up meetingEvery morning when I arrived at our office building, our team would have a daily stand-up meeting to talk about our progress and check the obstacles in our work. It was usually about 10 minutes, and it marked the start of my day at work. This was also my best chance to know about what other people in my team were working on. Gradually, I gained a more comprehensive understanding of the projects‚Äô status in my team as well. Sprint start: getting my tasks on JIRASince I worked in a Scrum team, we had sprints. A sprint is like an iteration period. A normal sprint was 2 weeks usually. When the sprint started, we would have an Iteration (or Sprint) Planning Meeting (IPM). In this meeting, we would discuss how much of the backlog could be committed to and delivered in this sprint. The tasks would be evaluated in story points. After the sprint started, I would have several tasks on JIRA which showed the work I needed to get done in this sprint. I was also responsible to update my task status every day. Sprint ongoing: develop, discuss, and deliverDuring the sprint, I would discuss some ambiguous points with the Product Owner and code to meet the expectations. This process also included a lot of conversations with the UI/UX designer, the Quality Assurance Engineer, the Backend Development Engineer, and even people from other teams or departments. At first I was super shy and it was a big challenge for me to gather the courage to start conversations with so many people. It was because of how nice the people here were that made me comfortable to express my opinion and become more and more confident. When I thought my code was ready, I would inform a QA Engineer to put my code into testing. When the testings were passed, and the PO thought it fulfilled the acceptance criteria, my code would go online to our shopping program for people to use. Snacks were amazing!!Here we had different kinds of snacks and fruit every day. I loved the cheesecakes - I know it‚Äôs not that healthy - which were so beautiful and delicious. The kiwis here were always sweeter than the ones I brought from the market. And when there was an activity or party, we had more. There were yogurt, bread, chocolate cake, fried chicken, meatballs, sausages, cookies, sushis, more than ten kinds of drinks‚Ä¶ Summary2020 was definitely a special year for many people. For me as well. Instead of pursuing my graduate study right after finishing my undergrad study as I originally planned, I was ‚Äúforced‚Äù by COVID-19 to take a gap year and did my first formal internship in life. I was lucky enough to spend that year with people at IKEA. I wanted to thank everyone in my team, who was the kindest person and most willing to answer my questions at any time. I also wanted to especially thank my line manager Leo and my mentor, Ciki, who perfected my internship. When I first arrived at IKEA, I almost knew nothing about real-industry software development. Ciki was always happy to give me useful instructions and show me the right direction to work in. It was a great time working here, and the people here were so welcoming and so supportive to me.
